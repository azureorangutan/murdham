## Introduction

This scenario assumes that the Players are travelling to the city of Bowport and spend the night at the Emerald Ermine, a reputable roadside inn.
Quite a few of the other guests, however, are hiding their true identities and will create serious trouble during the evening.

A couple of Ilatian Brothers, *Mercurio and Terenzio De Vini*, are actually members of the Mercatore family, a notorious criminal gang.
They have stolen a dangerous artifact, the Grandfather's Pupil, from the cult of the Violet Eye, and are now carrying it back to the head of their family, who plans to use it as a weapon against one of his rivals.

Unbeknownst to them, *Benford Burdham*, sorcerer and cult member, has followed them to the inn, and is waiting for the right opportunity to take back the stolen artifact.
He has disguised himself as a rat with magic.

*Olga Schwerkopf*, a witch hunter posing as a simple road warden, knows about what Mercurio and Terenzio are trying to smuggle.
She has also heard rumours that the cultists have dispatched someone to take the artifact back. She wants to use the De Vini brothers as bait to catch a cultist, interrogate him, and unmask who the other cult members are.

*Claretta and Eugene Atterberry*, a newly wed couple, seem to be enjoying the evening.
Claretta is actually *Lady Emilia of Thornwood*, who has decided to elope with her lover to escape an arranged marriage with *Viscount Darren of Grahm*.
Regrettably, the Viscount has learnt of what happened and where they are headed from a talkative handmaid, and will arrive at the inn trying to get her betrothed back by force.

A few other guests might get involved.
*Margery Tanner*, a student dabbling in magic, might raise Olga's suspicions and be exploited by Benford.
*Trum the ogre* has a short fuse and is deeply scared of rats, his violent temper might cause trouble.
*Peter Dearce* is a coach driver, currently carrying the Atterberries, Margery, and the De Vino brothers to Bowport.
*Francis Goose* is a slightly dishonest merchant carrying a few interesting and potentially illegal goods.

## Events

### Arrival

* The Players arrive at the inn.
* Numerous guests, the inn looks quite full.
  * Large ogre, eating a whole goose, drinking from a huge tankard (Trum).
  * Two people playing cards, one short, bald, and plump, the other wearing the uniform of the coaching company (Mercurio and Peter). A third man, dressed in yellow silk, is watching them play (Franz).
  * A young, handsome musician playing the lute (Mortimer), a young woman sitting next stares at him, infatuated.
  * A petite woman sits in a corner, buried behind a large book covering half her face (Margery).
* The innkeeper, an old man with a bushy mustache, greets the Players from behind the bar table.
  * He says that food and board cost 4ʂ per person.
  * A rat (Benford) runs across the floor squeaking. The innkeeper throws a mug at it, and barely misses. He apologises for the inconvenience, and offers a reward of 4ʂ for catching the vermin.
  * Happy to chat. Asks for information, news and rumours. Will share gossip about the guests, and rumours about the surrounding areas.
    * He warns against bothering Trum the ogre. He has quite a short temper.
    * He says that the Fletcher look like a lovely couple. They are newly wed.
    * The De Vino brothers look suspicious to him, he doesn't like Ilatians, they aren't trustworthy.
    * Doesn't know much about Margery, the girl doesn't talk much.
    * There is a festival happening at Bowport. Lots of people are travelling there for fun or business.
    * There are rumours of bandits on the road between the inn and Bowport. Better to be well prepared!


### The road warden

* A tall, muscular woman in uniform enters the inn (Olga).
* She approaches the innkeeper (asking information about the guests).
* Mercurio wins a large sum, then declares he is too tired and wishes to stop playing. Peter throws a few curses, then orders another tankard of ale to drawn his sorrow. Franz laughs loudly. Trum, nearby, looks at them and grunts.


### Interrogation

* Olga approaches the Players. She asks where they come from, where they are headed, what's their occupation and reason for travel.
  * If she finds out or suspects that a Player is a wizard, she will suspect them of being cultists.
  * If she thinks the Player are trustworthy or particularly devout, she will share her real goal: she is a hunting a demon cultist hiding at the inn! She will offer a reward of 32ʂ per person for help.
  * If asked why so many questions, she will say it's just part of her job.
  * After talking with the Players, Olga will head to interrogate other customers, starting with Margery.
* The music stops. Claretta and Mortimer retire upstairs, giggling.


### The Viscount

* A man in rich clothes with a pointy goatee enters the inn (the Viscount), accompanied by a valet and three armed men.
  * He approaches the innkeeper, and asks if Lady Emilia is lodging at the inn. The innkeeper doesn't know that it is Claretta Fletcher.
  * He sends one man-at-arm to patrol outside, one to patrol the floor upstairs, and then sits at a table after ordering some food and drinks. He looks displeased.
* The valet starts approaching the guests, including the Players, asking for information. He offers a reward of 32ʂ per person for any help finding Lady Emilia.


### Rat scare

* Margery screams loudly and jumps under the table. Her book lays open on the table, with a rat on top of it, sniffing around.
  * Benford noticed that Margery had a profane scroll. He wanted to double check it to see if it could help. He now knows it is a _summon demon_ spell.
* The innkeeper throws curses at the vermin and reaches for his broom. Before he can do anything, Olga jumps at the rat trying to catch it.
  * In reality, Olga wants to have a look at Margery's book. She recognises that, hidden among the pages, is a profane scroll. She concludes, wrongly, that Margery is likely the cultist.
* Faint lute music can be heard coming from upstairs.


### A loud thump

* Margery decides she has had enough for the night and retires to her room.
* Olga follows her immediately after.
* A loud thump can be heard from bar-room. The innkeeper looks up, then shakes his head and keeps working.
  * Olga has tried to confront Margery. Scared, she tried to run away and fell, hitting her head and knocking herself unconscious. Olga tied her up and left her in her room, together with her book, to be used later as avidence.
  * If the Players go upstairs, they can see this happening. Olga will explain what's going on.


### The Viscount revenge

* The music from upstairs stops. Excited laughs can be heard. The viscount asks his bodyguard to go upstairs and check.
* Olga comes back downstairs.


### Second rat scare

* The rat rushes towards Trum, spooking him and making him fall butt-first from his chair.
  * Peter, half drunk, laughs loudly at the scene. Trum doesn't appreciate: he stands up, looking at him with hatred, then proceeds to grab him and throw him into the fireplace.
  * The innkeeper takes a blunderbuss from under the counter and points it at the ogre, asking to stop. The ogre won't comply, and will try to finish the job with Peter. The innkeeper will shoot.
* A heavy thump, a woman's scream, and sounds of someone getting beaten up can be heard from upstairs.
  * The viscount's bodyguards have entered the room of the Fletcher's, found Lady Emilia, and roughed up her loved.
* Benford will take advantage of the confusion to steal the room key from Terenzio's pocket.


### The duel

* The Viscount's bodyguards bring a beaten up Eugene and a crying Lady Emilia, now wearing a night gown and showing her flowing red hair, downstairs.
* The Viscount declare what is happening, and challenges Eugene with a duel to protect his honour. He mentions that his bodyguard will fight for him.
* Eugene will desperately ask if anyone would fight for him. The Viscount scoffs at him. Unless the Players oblige, nobody will help him.
* The innkeeper asks to bring this outside: unless the Players have decided to fight for Eugene, the bodyguard will make short work of him and kill him, to the scream of Lady Emilia.
* After all this happens, the Viscount and his retinue will retire to their room, and a guard will be posted outside of Emilia's room. Unless someone rescues her, she will be found dead in the morning, suicide.


### The thief

* An explosion can be heard from upstairs. Mercurio and Terenzio look at each other, then rush towards their room.
  * Benford has turned back into human form, stolen the _summon demon_ scroll from Margery (he spied what happened earlier), opened the Mercatore brothers room with the stolen key, and looked for the chest containing the Grandfather's Eye.
  * He didn't expect the wardrobe where the chest was hidden to be booby trapped! A small amount of gunpowder exploded. Not harmful, but enough to warn the brothers that a thief is in their room!


### The demon

* The Mercatore will overwhelm Benford, bringing downstairs a naked, scrawny man, holding a piece of parchment in his hand. They will say he is a thief who tried to steal their belongings. They will ask the road warden to take care of him.
* Before Olga can do anything, belford will open the _summon demon_ scroll in his hand: this will bring a Horror in the room!
  * Olga will fight and the innkeeper will try to fire a shot. Trum, if still around, will also join the fight. Anyone else is too scared and will try to run away.
  * The demon will first attack the Mercatore brothers, seeing as they are closest to it.
  * Benford has no mana left, so he will suffer corruption upon casting. If he doesn't die and the spell is cast successfully, he will take advantage of the confusion to go back to the room upstairs, stealing the Grandfather's eye and running away.



## Running the inn

The previous section describes what happens if the Players pretty much do nothing and just observe what goes on, trying not to interfere.
However, they might try to get involved, at which point things might go very differently!
As the GM, you will then have to improvise and decide how the different actors will behave.

Here are a few guidelines on how the characters might react to the Players' actions.

* Franz will gladly trade with the Players. If they show interest, he will invite them to his room, where he keeps his wares in a study, locked chest. He has the _bargain_ skill and will further slash buying prices in half. He has a selection of weapons, poisons, medicine, and other gear in stock.

* Mercurio will play cards with the Players if they are interested. He will try to cheat.

* If the Players try to disturb the pace or are caught stealing upstairs, the innkeeper and his son will try to stop them, armed with blunderbusses and knives.

* If the Players ask for transportation to their next destination, there are a few options.
  * The coach driver won't take any more passengers, as his coach is full. However, if something were to happen to some of the passengers, some spots might free up...
  * The innkeeper mentions there is a broken old cart in the stables. If the Players can fix it, it's theirs. He can rent a couple of horses for 16ʂ each, to be given back at the next coaching inn.
  * An old fishing boat is moored at the inn's pier. It belongs to the innkeeper, but the Players might steal it.
  * Franz sells camping kits and rations. The Players might opt to travel on foot, and will need supplies to camp if it takes longer than a day.


## The inn

...


## Dramatis Personae

You should familiarise yourself with the guests at the inn and their goals.
At some point, you will have to improvise how they will act to what happens at the inn!


### Claretta and Mortimer Fletcher, young married couple

Claretta is a young, pretty lady, with elegant manners and jovial green eyes.
She wears clean, good quality travel clothes, with a cloak hiding her beautiful read hair.
She is all eyes for her husband, Mortimer.

Mortimer dashing young fellow, with long, luscious brown hair and fashionable clothes.
He looks slightly nervous and uneasy.

The two are, allegedly, husband and wife, travelling to Bowport to build a new life.
In reality, she is Lady Emilia, daughter of the Baron of Thornwood, and he is Eugene Atterberry, a young musician with whom she has fallen in love.
The two have decided to elope after her hand was promised in marriage to the Viscount of Grahm.


### Viscount Darren of Grahm and retinue

The Viscount is a balding middle aged man with a well trimmed, pointy, black goatee.
He wears fine clothes with the crest of his family, depicting a horse with a trout tail.
He is clearly full of himself, and displeased by the fact he has to mingle with lowly scum to find her fiancee.

He was supposed to marry Lady Emilia, but she disappeared and set off to find her.
A handmaid told her where she was headed, and he set off to find her together with his retinue: his valet Alphonse Frets, his personal body guard Mark Fowler, and two man-at-arms.
He will arrive at the inn a short while after the Players, and will start investigating if Emilia is there.


### Mercurio and Terenzio De Vini, travelling brothers

Mercurio is short, plump, and bolding.
He wears simple but comfortable clothes.
He is talkative and thinks he is much smarter then he actually is.
He loves to play cards, gamble, and cheat.

Terenzio is extremely tall and muscular, a mountain of a man.
He doesn't speak much and tends to drink too much wine.

They are two brothers originally from the southern free cities of Ilatia.
They are actually travelling in disguise: their real names are Mercurio and Terenzio Mercatore, members of a notorious criminal gang of Bowport.
They have stolen a magic artifact from a dangerous cult, and are now carrying it back to the head of their family.


### Benford Burdham, sorcerer and rat

A middle aged, skinny man, with thin brown hair and a big nose.
He is a sorcerer and has actually turned himself into a rat using the _animal shape_ power.
He is smart, but also risk-averse: will try his best to avoid any kind of issue.

He is a member of the cult of the Shadow Hand, worshipping the dark gods.
He has been tasked to retrieve the Eye of the Grandfather, the artifact stolen by the Mercatore brothers.
He has infiltrated the inn as a rat, and is now trying to formulate a plan to recover the artifact and escape.
It doesn't help that the innkeeper is trying to kill him, and that a witch huntress is on his trail...


### Olga Schwerkopf, road warden

A stocky, plump, muscular woman, her face burn-scarred.
She wears a road-warden uniform and carries a pistol and a nice-looking sword.
Smart and observant, she asks a lot of questions but keeps her mouth shut.

Olga is posing as a road-warden but is actually a witch hunter looking for Benford.
She found out that the Mercatore stole the artifact, and spread the rumour in the hope that a cult member would follow them.
She could then apprehend and interrogate them to unmask the cult.
She will arrive at the inn after the Players and will start interrogating the guests to find out if sorcerers are there.
She is sure that magic is present in the inn, but has no idea whom she is actually looking for, and that they are actually currently poising as a rat!


### Margery Tanner, scholar

A petite young lady with tidy blonde hair, deep into reading a huge tome.
Doesn't talk much, and seems to be constantly looking around from her corner, as if she is afraid of someone.

A young student returning to Bowport for her studies.
She secretly wants to become a witch, and has acquired a profane scroll which she is now trying very hard to decipher.
She has no idea that the scroll contains a _summon demon_ spell, but she is trying her best to pretend she is just studying a philosophy book.
She is here purely by chance, but she might become a suspect for Olga, while Benford might find a use for her scroll...


### Trum, ogre adventurer

A huge, muscular, bald ogre, wearing a helmet too small for his big head.
Constantly drinks and eats: the more drunk he gets, the more aggressive.
He thinks everyone wants to make fun of him.

Trum is travelling to Bowport to offer his services as an adventurer.
He is a strong brawler and his fists hit like a sledgehammer.
He doesn't have any secrets, but will get angry if anyone makes fun of him, which will result in him starting a brawl.


### Peter Dearce, coach driver

A simple man with a mustache, wearing the uniform of the Gallant Horse coaching company.
Talks quite loudly.

Peter is driving the Fletchers, the De Vini brothers, Margery Tanner, and Franz Guenther to Bowport.
His plan is to spend the evening getting drunk and playing cards with Mercurio.
He is getting fleeced, but he is too tipsy to notice.


### Gerard Alebottom, inkeeper

An old man in his fifties, with a bushy white mustache.
He has kind temperament, but worries a lot.

The innkeeper is happy that his inn has good business, but has quite a few worries.
A pesky rat (Benford) has shown up, and he is afraid it might bother the customers.
He will be very happy if someone could get rid of it.
He is also quite concerned about Trum the ogre: he can smell trouble.

His family helps him run the inn: his wife Gremilda runs the kitchen, his son Rudolf is the stable-boy, and his daughters Grethel and Pomissa are waitresses.


### Franz Guenther, merchant

A portly man wearing flashy yellow robes.
He speaks with a strong foreign accent.

Franz is a merchant travelling back to Bowport with some merchandise to sell.
He currently keeps it in a locked chest in his bedroom.
He will be more than happy to trade with the Players: if they wish to do so, he will take them to his room to show them his wares.


### Other guests

There are a few other guests in the inn, but they aren't important for the purpose of the scenario.
Just make sure to mention this to the Players, to give the idea of a full and lively atmosphere.
Feel free to introduce new characters to the mix if you need them, or to use a guest as a replacement character in case a Player meets an early demise...




## Events

You should keep track of time in stretches during this adventure.
During each stretch, ask what the Players would like to do.
More than likely, they will do one of two things: talk with someone, or go about exploring the inn.
At the end of the stretch, play out one of the following events to update the situation.

You should try to follow the events in order, as long as you can.
At some point, the actions of the Players might make some events impossible or obsolete: when that happens, just skip over them, or make up how the situation evolves.


### Arrival
The Players enter the inn.

* The inn looks quite full and lively.
A few people stand out.

* Burly ogre eating a whole chicken and drinking from a giant mug (Trum).

* A couple of people playing cards, with a third man observing them (Mercurio De Vini and Peter Dearce playing, Franz Guenter observing).

* A young, handsome fellow playing the lute, a young woman looking at him, infatuated (the Fletchers).

* Innkeeper, bushy white mustache, welcomes you as you enter (Gerard Alebottom).

The Viscount and Olga haven't arrived at the inn yet.
Benford is there, but transformed into a rat.
Terenzio is currently in his room, and so are a few guests who retired early.


### The road warden

Olga arrives.
From her uniform, anyone can tell that she clearly is a road warden.
She goes to speak with the innkeeper, asking questions about the guests.
After that, she will start making rounds talking with other guests.


### End of the music

Mortimer Fletcher stops playing and retires upstairs with his wife.
He is slightly tipsy, and bumps Trum on his way up.
The giant roars at him, then proceeds to keep drinking from his mug.




## Player involvement

### Talking with the innkeeper

This is probably the first thing that the Players will do.
The innkeeper will state prices for lodging (4ʂ per person).

Will also warn that there seems to be a rat, or rats, running around the inn: asks to let him know if they see something.
Will offer a reward of 4ʂ for each caught rat.
He doesn't know that the rat he has seen is actually Belford.

Will also warn against bothering Trum the ogre.
He says he can feel he has rather bad temper.

Will be happy to chat, and will gladly spill the beans about what he knows about other guests.
He will also ask questions about where the Players are headed, if they carry any news, and so on.


### Talking with Olga

Olga will ask the Players many questions: where they come from, where they are headed, what's their occupation, and so on.
If questioned about her curiosity, she will just casually mention it is part of her job.
If she finds out, or suspects, that one of the Players is a wizard or is corrupted, she will become very wary of them.
On the other hand, if she finds out that they are pious and faithful, she might open up and declare her true goal: uncover a dangerous cultist at the inn.
