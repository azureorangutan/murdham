## Characters
Characters are the inhabitants of the game world: people, animals, and monsters.
Every player controls one character and their followers, and the GM controls all others, both friends and foes.


## Abilities
The 3 abilities represent a character's fundamental characteristics:
* **Strength (STR)**: brawn, fortitude, toughness.
* **Agility (AGI)**: athleticism, finesse, reflexes.
* **Wits (WIT)**: awareness, cunning, willpower.

Each ability has a numerical **score**, which can never exceed 19, or 15 for humans.
If any score drops to 0, the character dies.
Ability gains and losses aren't permanent, unless explicitly indicated, and are reverted by resting.



## Traits
**Traits** are keywords indicating peculiar capabilities or flaws.
They have no numerical score: a character either has a trait or not.
They can be permanent or temporary, in which case the rules specify a duration or ending trigger.

**Skills** are a special type of trait which can be acquired with experience and training.
Characters can have at most 6 skills.

**Afflictions** are negative, temporary traits.


## Trappings
**Trappings** are a character's assets, including **items**, **followers**, and **shillings (ʂ)**, the currency used in the game world.

Items have a **bulk** value indicating how hard they are to carry.
If unspecified, it is assumed to be 1.
Sets of 32 shillings have bulk 1, but spare change up to 31 shillings has no significant bulk.


## Secondary properties
* **Health**: the ability to withstand damage.
  Maximum health equals STR, and it can't drop below 0.
* **Armour**: reduces incoming damage.
  By default 0, can’t exceed 3.
* **Corruption**: spiritual taint caused by the use of magic and by demonic influence.
  Initially 0, it increases when exposed to corrupting influences.
* **Omens**: luck and divine favour.
  Player characters start with 2 omens, and can’t have more than 6.
* **Mana**: the ability to cast arcane spells safely.
  Initially 0, can’t exceed 6.
* **Size**: *tiny*, *medium*, or *huge*.
  Humans are *medium*.
* **Carry limit**: measures how much the character can carry, and also matches the character's own bulk.
  It equals 16 for humans.


## Profile format
The profile of GM characters and monsters is given in the following format.
Size is omitted if *medium*.
Health is omitted if equal to STR.
Mana, omens, and armour are omitted if equal to 0, and carry limit if equal to 16.

## Character sheet
Players can keep track of their characters using character sheets from the [Game Resources]({{< relref "../game_resources/_index.md" >}}) page.
They are formatted to be printed on A5 paper (or two copies on A4 paper).

![Character Sheet](/pics/murdham_character_sheet_example.jpg)

* **Name and portrait**: write the character's name at the top of the middle column, and portray them inside the box below.

* **Inventory**: write the character's item here, using one rectangle per unit of bulk.
  At the bottom, mark the box if you are wearing clothes (you never know!), and keep track of spare change up to 31ʂ.
  Instead of writing your items directly on the sheet,
  you can use the chits from the [Game Resources]({{< relref "../game_resources/_index.md" >}}) page, as shown in the picture.
  Print them, cut them out, and write the item name on a chit matching its bulk when a Player acquires a new item.

* **Abilities**: write each score on the left side.
  Use the right side for temporarily altered scores (in the picture, WIT was temporarily reduced from 9 to 8).

* **Skills**: write the character's skills here, one per line.

* **Afflictions**: keep track of afflictions here, one per box.
  You can optionally use item chits to keep track of afflictions as well.

* **Secondary properties**: track these values in the corresponding boxes.
  All except corruption and armour have a separate space to mark the maximum.
  Since size and carry limit are the same for all Player characters, there are no spaces to track them.

* **Description**: a few boxes to write down the description entries from character creation.

* **Traits & Notes**: keep track of other traits and additional information here.
