## Site maps
Scenes happen on a **site map**, which is divided into **zones** (a small room, part of a larger room, a road section, etc.).
The GM reveals the map to the Players zone by zone as they explore, drawing it on paper.

Zones can vary in size and shape, following the features of the environment, but their largest dimension shouldn't exceed 10 metres.
The height of a zone is assumed to be 2 to 3 metres, roughly the height of one building floor.


## Positioning
You should track not only the zone where each character is, but also where they are exactly within its boundaries.
For example, a character might be next to a door, blocking passage, or next to an enemy.
Keep track of where they are exactly by placing a mark or token on the map.


## Occupancy limit
Zones can contain a limited number of characters depending on their surface and shape.
As a guideline, characters occupy an area with a diameter of 2 metres.
It is possible to move through a full area, but not stop in it.


## Range categories
Distances are expressed using the following range categories:
* **Nearby**: within arm’s reach (2 metres).
  Note that something in a different zone can be nearby a character who is near the border.
  Conversely, something in the same zone isn't necessarily nearby.
* **Close**: in the same or an adjacent zone.
* **Far**: within 4 zones.
* **Extreme**: beyond 4 zones, but still on the same site map.


## Movement
Characters can move 1 zone when activated, before taking action.
As a round action, they can **rush** to move 1 additional zone.
*Slow* characters can't rush.
*Fast* characters move 2 zones, plus 2 zones if they rush.

Characters can position themselves anywhere within the destination zone.
They must be able to trace an uninterrupted path between their starting and final positions.
It is possible to trace the path through other characters, but not through walls or other such obstacles.


## Pinning
Characters can attempt to pin other characters who are moving within nearby range, including when they try to move through them.
The moving character must make a STR or AGI roll.
If they fail, they must immediately end their movement, and the pinning character can place them anywhere within nearby range.


## Balancing
Balancing on rough surfaces (narrow, uneven, or slippery) requires passing an AGI roll at the end of the activation and when leaving the challenging area to avoid falling.
It isn't possible to balance on extremely rough surfaces (for example, narrow *and* slippery).


## Climbing
Climbing challenging surfaces (rocky cliffs, slippery ladders, etc.) requires passing an AGI roll at the end of the activation and at the top of the climb to avoid falling.
Trivial surfaces (ladders, ropes, etc.) require no roll.
Extremely challenging surfaces (walls, slippery cliffs, etc.) can't be climbed.


## Swimming
Swimming in turbulent waters or while carrying more than one-fourth the carry limit (usually 4 bulk) requires passing an AGI roll at the end of the activation and when leaving the water to avoid drowning.
Drowning characters follow the suffocation rules and are too tired to keep swimming: they are carried by the current and must be rescued by someone else.
It isn't possible to swim while in turbulent waters *and* carrying too much.


## Leaping
Leaping a distance of 2 to 4 metres (or half that without a running start) requires passing an AGI roll to avoid falling into the gap.
Crossing shorter distances is trivial, and leaping over longer distances is impossible.
