## Creating a character
Follow the steps outlined in this chapter to create a player character.
Unlike in other similar games, character creation is fully randomised.
You can use the [online character generator]({{< relref "../character_generator/_index.md" >}}) to instantly create characters with a click.

With the GM agreement, players can also pick and choose what they want at different steps, or tweak their character to their liking.
Before doing that though, think if you really need that: it can be extremely fun to play an unexpected and unusual character!

These creation rules apply to player characters only.
The GM is free to define other characters to their liking.


## 1. Abilities
Roll a d8 on the table below to determine an array of 3 ability scores, then assign them randomly.
1. Roll a d3 to assign the highest score: 1) STR; 2) AGI; 3) WIT.
1. Roll a d2 to assign the middle score, skipping over the previously assigned ability.
1. Assign the lowest score to the last remaining ability.

|  D8   | Ability scores |  D8   | Ability scores |
| :---: | :------------: | :---: | :------------: |
|   1   |    8, 7, 7     |   2   |    8, 8, 6     |
|   3   |    9, 7, 6     |   4   |    9, 8, 5     |
|   5   |    10, 6, 6    |   6   |    10, 7, 5    |
