## Resting
As a watch action, characters can take a **rest**.
They should do so after two watches spent doing something else.
They can push themselves for a third watch at the cost of being *groggy* during that time, but on the fourth watch, they must rest.

Characters taking a rest must try to eat, drink, and have a good sleep.
If they can, they recover all health, recover 1 mana, and restore 1 point of ability loss.
If they can't, they lose 1 STR if they couldn't eat, 1 AGI if they couldn't drink, and 1 WIT if they couldn't sleep well.

While in town, it is possible to purchase a meal (to eat and drink) and lodging (to sleep well) for 2ʂ each, in total 4ʂ.

Camping in the wilderness requires a *ration* to eat, a filled *waterskin* to drink, and a *camping kit* to sleep well.
Animal followers don't need a *camping kit* and can find their own food and water in their natural habitat.


## Foraging
As a watch action, characters can **forage** for food in the wilderness.
Roll on the table below to see what they find.
**Butchering** an animal carcass is a stretch action and yields *perishable rations* equal to STR/4.

|  D6   | Foraging you find...                                                                                                               |
| :---: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | **Choice**. Pick any other entry.                                                                                                  |
|   2   | **Fruits and vegetables**. 1 *perishable ration* if the region isn't barren.                                                       |
|   3   | **Fish**. With a *fishing kit*, 2 *perishable rations* if there is water in the region.                                            |
|   4   | **Critters**. With a *trapping kit*, 2 *perishable rations* if tiny animals live in the region.                                    |
|   5   | **Prey**. Track a beast with a WIT roll and then attempt to kill it for food. What beasts can be found depends on the local fauna. |
|   6   | **Water**. A source of water to drink and refill *waterskins*, if the region isn't barren.                                         |


## Downtime
Characters can spend 4 days in town and pay 64ʂ each to enter downtime.
The cost includes food, water, lodging, entertainment, and healing.
If they can't pay, they can't enter downtime.

During downtime, characters recover all health, mana, and spent omens, and restore all abilities to the original score.
Afflictions and traits lasting until downtime or shorter are removed.


## Advancement
If the Player characters have achieved something significant, the GM may grant them an advancement, which can be spent in one of the following ways during downtime:
* Learn a new skill (at most 6).
  You must be able to justify how the character learnt it, or else pay 64ʂ for training.
* Increase ability scores by a total of 2 (no ability can exceed 15).
* If the character has the *lucky* skill: increase omens by 1 (at most 6).
* If the character has the *sorcery* skill: increase mana by 1 (at most 6).
