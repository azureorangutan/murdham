## Grid-based movement
You can divide site maps using a square grid rather than zones.
A square represents an area of 2 metres by 2 metres.
Multiply distances by 4 to convert from zones to squares, for example to determine movement speed.

Size determines the area occupied by a character:
* Medium characters occupy one square.
* Huge characters occupy an area of 2Ã—2 squares.
* Tiny characters occupy a quarter of a square.

Range categories are defined as follows:
* Nearby: within 1 square for medium characters, 2 squares for huge characters, half square for tiny characters.
* Close: within 8 squares.
* Far: within 32 squares.
* Extreme: beyond 32 squares.


## Experience for money
In scenarios and campaigns based on treasure-hunting, the GM can award experience using the experience for money method.
Player characters earn experience points by spending money, at a rate of one experience point per shilling, and advance at certain thresholds (the table below shows indicative values).
Money spent in this way is lost and can't be retrieved in any way: it is stashed away for retirement, wasted carousing, donated to a good cause, etc.

| Advancement | Experience required | Advancement | Experience required |
| :---------: | :-----------------: | :---------: | :-----------------: |
|      1      |         125         |      2      |         250         |
|      3      |         500         |      4      |        1,000        |
|      5      |        2,000        |      6      |        4,000        |
|      7      |        8,000        |      8      |       16,000        |
|      9      |       32,000        |     10      |       64,000        |
|     11      |       96,000        |     12+     |     Add 32,000      |



## Chaos of combat
This is an optional rule you can use to represent the chaotic nature of combat and to reduce the amount of time spent to resolve fights if the players suffer from analysis-paralysis and tend to overthink their turn.
* The players are only allowed to say a short sentence during their turn.
  Longer discussions consume a round action.
* Each player has 15 seconds to declare what they intend to do on their turn, otherwise they do nothing.
This doesn't include the time required to actually resolve the actions, take all the time you need to roll dice, assign damage, and so on.
