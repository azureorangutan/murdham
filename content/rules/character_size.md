## Encumbrance and reach
* Tiny/medium/huge characters occupy an area of 1/2/4 metres in diameter.
* Tiny/medium/huge characters consider anything within 1/2/4 metres to be nearby.
* The carry limit and bulk of tiny/medium/huge characters are 2/16/128.


## Ability rolls
Larger characters always pass STR rolls against smaller characters, and always fail AGI and WIT rolls when their size is a disadvantage.
The opposite is true for smaller characters.


## Attacks
* Attacks targeting a character one size smaller/larger multiply/divide damage by 4.
  Tiny characters can't damage huge characters, and huge characters instantly kill tiny characters.
  Damage from blast attacks is unaffected.
* Larger characters can make a sweep melee attack.
  The attack hits all nearby smaller characters, inflicting unmodified damage.
* It is impossible to disarm, shove, or grab larger characters, while smaller characters are automatically disarmed, shoved, or grabbed.
  When shoving, a larger attacker can choose to throw the target within close range, inflicting d4 direct damage.
* Ranged attacks against smaller targets always require a WIT roll to hit and can't hit beyond close range.
  Ranged attacks against larger characters don't require a WIT roll at far range.
