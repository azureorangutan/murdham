## Overland map
Overland play happens on an overland map, which is divided into **regions**.
Regions are pretty much equivalent to zones, but on a much larger scale: their largest dimension shouldn't exceed 10 kilometres.


## Travel
As a watch action, the whole company can travel across 2 regions.
*Slow* characters can only move 1 region.
*Fast* characters can move 4 regions, but only on open terrain.

The company can stop anywhere within the destination region.
It must be possible to trace an uninterrupted path between its starting and final positions.


## Crossing rivers
Crossing a river without a bridge or ford requires swimming.
Characters might be forced to leave equipment behind, and must pass an AGI roll to swim safely to the other side if the water is turbulent or they are carrying too much.


## Pathfinding
If the company travels without following a road or landmark, one character must act as a guide and make a WIT roll each time the company attempts to leave a region.
If they fail, they get lost or slowed down by harsh terrain and stay where they are, wasting one region worth of movement.


## Sites
When the company enters a new region, the GM declares if there are any visible sites within, such as settlements or landmarks.
Hidden sites aren't immediately revealed.

As a watch action, characters can **explore** their region.
The GM reveals a hidden site, or otherwise declares if the region has been fully explored.

Characters can enter a nearby site, giving start to a scene.
If the site is not in the immediate vicinity, even though within the same region, it is necessary to spend a watch action to travel to it before entering.


## Settlements
As a watch action, characters can **visit the market** in town.
They can purchase items and services at full price, and sell items at half price.
Goods in short supply might be worth double or be unavailable.

As a watch action, characters can **look for a contact** in town.
It could be someone willing to buy an item at full price, a merchant selling rare goods, a fence willing to trade illegal merchandise, etc.

As a watch action, characters can **hustle** in town to earn d4ʂ in town by begging, playing an instrument, taking odd jobs, etc.


## Weather
Under heavy rain or snow, movement speed is halved and sleeping well while camping isn't possible without shelter.
**Finding shelter** is a watch action and requires passing a WIT roll.

Characters in hot environments must drink twice the normal amount of water each day.
Characters in cold environments suffer d4 cold damage at the end of each watch and can't sleep well while camping unless they wear *warm clothes*.
