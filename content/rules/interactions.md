## Environment interactions
Interacting with an object or the environment can be a quick, main, or stretch action, depending on how long it would take.
* **Quick actions**: open a door, pull a lever, press a switch, etc.
* **Round actions**: pick a lock, make a few moves on a puzzle box, etc.
* **Stretch actions**: carefully pick a lock, repair something, etc.


## Changing equipment
As a round action, characters can **equip**, **unequip**, or **change** shield or clothing.
As a stretch action, they can equip, unequip, or change armour.
Changing items held in hand, except shields, is a quick action.


## Dropping & picking up
As a round action, characters can **pick up** any number of items in their zone.
As a quick action, characters can **drop** any number of items into their zone.


## Stealing
As a round action, characters can attempt to **steal** a bulk 1 item or up to 32ʂ from a nearby **unaware** character by making an AGI roll.
If they pass, they steal the item unnoticed and can move 1 zone without making noise.
If they fail, they steal the item but are noticed by the victim and can't move further.
Items worn or held can't be stolen.


## Robbing
As a round action, characters can **rob** an item or up to 32ʂ from a nearby character.
While stealing represents trying to take something unnoticed, robbing is a more direct, visible approach.
The victim is alerted and must pass a STR or AGI roll or lose the item.
Worn items can't be robbed, but held items can.


## Talking
As a round action, characters can **talk** with someone and have a single exchange consisting of a statement and a reply.
Typical exchanges are:
* Asking a question and receiving an answer.
* Sharing information.
* Giving an order.
* Attempting to persuade or manipulate.
* Proposing a deal and accepting, refusing, or making a counter-offer.


## Attitude
The attitude of GM characters is expressed by the levels in the table below.
The GM picks the most suitable one, or rolls a d6 if uncertain.
If the characters are particularly peaceful or aggressive, roll two d6s and keep the lower or higher roll, respectively.

Gifts and favours can improve a character's attitude.
Conversely, aggression, intimidation, lies, offences, exploitation, and manipulation can worsen it.

|  D6   | Attitude                                        |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | **Friendly**. Open to help, within reason.      |
|  2-3  | **Neutral**. Open to mutually beneficial deals. |
|  4-5  | **Unfriendly**. Refuses to willingly cooperate. |
|   6   | **Hostile**. Actively tries to harm.            |


## Persuading
Persuading someone of something they aren't inclined to believe requires good arguments and passing a WIT roll.
If the arguments are solid and supported by evidence, the roll isn't required.


## Manipulating
Manipulating someone into doing or revealing something requires a suitable approach, such as taunting, seducing, intimidating, etc.
The target can resist with a WIT roll unless the attempt is particularly good.


## Deals
As an exchange, characters can propose a deal, and their interlocutor can either accept, refuse, or make a counter-offer.
It is possible to trade items, money, favours, information, or anything else of value.

GM characters will typically only accept balanced deals, but what this means can change based on circumstances, leverage, and attitude.
It is even possible to ask for something in exchange for nothing in return, but this would typically only be accepted by friendly characters or when speaking from a position of strength.
