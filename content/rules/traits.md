## Afflictions
* **Encumbered**.
  Characters who are carrying more than half their carry limit are *encumbered*.
  They must pass an additional STR roll each time they make an AGI roll or fail.
* **Entangled**.
  The character can't do anything except trying to break free as a round action by passing a STR roll.
  Others can also spend a round action and pass a STR roll to free an *entangled* character.
* **Groggy**.
  The character's AGI and WIT are halved for the purpose of resolving ability rolls.
  Characters who become *groggy* again before recovering are *incapacitated* instead.
* **Incapacitated**.
  The character is unconscious, stunned, asleep, or in pain, and can't do anything.
* **Infected**.
  The character has contracted a disease and must make a STR roll at the end of each day.
  If they fail, they lose 2 STR, 2 AGI, and 2 WIT, as symptoms appear and worsen.
  If they pass on 2 consecutive days, they recover and develop immunity.
  Specific diseases might have additional or alternative effects.
* **Poisoned**.
  The character will suffer the effects of the poison after a specified time unless they take an *antidote*.
