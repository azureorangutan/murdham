## Mounts
Characters can ride a trained mount with a *saddle*.
They count, with equipment, towards the mount's encumbrance.
In dangerous situations (the mount sprints, is scared, does something requiring an AGI roll, etc.),
the rider must pass an AGI roll or be thrown off the saddle, suffering d4 direct damage.


## Vehicles
Vehicles such as carts and boats are operated by a crew, with one member acting as the driver.
In dangerous situations, the driver must pass a WIT roll to avoid crashing.
If that happens, the vehicle, crew members, and passengers suffer d4 direct damage and might be thrown out.
* **Carts**.
  Driven by one person and pulled by one or more draft animals.
  The cart itself, but not passengers and goods transported on it, counts towards the encumbrance of the draft animals.
* **Boats**.
  They move by 6 areas per time unit with the current, or by 2 against it.
  Must be rowed by every character on board, or speed is reduced proportionally.
* **Sailing boats**.
  In the presence of wind, they move up to 6 areas per time unit without rowing.


## Mounts and vehicles in combat
A mount and its riders, or a vehicle with its crew and passengers, form a unit in combat.
* Unit members take turns separately but move together.
  Vehicles don't take their own turn.
* The unit can only move when the first member activates during the round.
  If they rush, it counts as the turn for all members.
* Characters can mount/dismount/embark/disembark as part of their movement, but only if the unit hasn't moved yet.
  The unit can move after someone dismounts/disembarks, but not after someone mounts/embarks.
* Attacks target unit members separately, who also react separately.
  A unit can still move even if some members have reacted previously during the turn, and members can react even after the unit has moved.
