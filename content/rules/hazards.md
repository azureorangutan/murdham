## Disease
Characters who come into contact with a disease become *infected*.
*Infected* characters must make a STR roll at the end of each day, called a **disease roll**.
If they fail, they lose 2 STR, 2 AGI, and 2 WIT, as symptoms appear and worsen.
If they pass on 2 consecutive days, they recover and develop immunity.

Specific diseases might have additional or alternative effects:
1. **Flu**.
  Symptoms: fever, coughing, sneezing, sore throat, digestive issues.
  Victims don't gain immunity after recovering.
1. **Bloody flu**.
  Behaves exactly like the flu, but people are irrationally afraid of it.
1. **Black gangrene**.
  Symptoms: high fever, blackening of the feet.
  On the second failed disease roll, the feet start decomposing.
  They must be surgically amputated or the victim dies on the next day.
1. **Bloodburn**.
  Symptoms: strong headache, blurry visions, and the insatiable need to spill blood.
  Victims who fail a disease roll are *frenzied* during the next day.
1. **Creaking bones**.
  Symptoms: joint pain, fever, loud noise bending limbs.
  After the first failed disease roll, the victim emits loud noises at every movement until recovery, making it impossible to move silently.
2. **Demon pox**.
  Symptoms: hallucinations and weird buboes, constantly changing shape and colour and slowly moving across the body.
  Victims additionally suffer 2 corruption each time they fail a disease roll.
1. **Digworm**.
  Symptoms: a parasite digging into the victim's skin and sucking their blood, causing fever, weakness, and hunger.
  Healing by passing disease rolls isn't possible: the parasite must be surgically removed.
  Disease are still required to resist ability loss.
  Not contagious.
  Victims don't gain immunity after recovering.
1. **Greater rot**.
  Symptoms: rotting flesh, pulsating buboes, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and high fever.
  On a fail disease roll, all abilities are reduced by 2 as usual, but one point for each ability is permanent.
1. **Plague**.
  Symptoms: fever and large buboes.
  Healing requires passing 3 consecutive disease rolls.
1. **Redskin**.
  Symptoms: reddened, dry, itching, painful skin.
  After the first failed disease roll, victims are unable to wear clothes or armour until recovery.
1. **Weeping sores**.
  Symptoms: painful sores appearing all over the body.
  On a failed disease roll, the victim loses d6 STR and AGI instead of d4, but WIT is unaffected.
1. **Vein worm**.
  Symptoms: a crawling feeling under the skin, constant itching.
  Victims are unable to sleep peacefully, and will always lack sleep when resting;
  however, they don't suffer ability loss on a failed disease roll.
  Healing by passing disease rolls isn't possible: the parasite must be surgically removed.
  Not contagious.
  Victims don't gain immunity after recovering.


## Falls
Falls cause d4/d8/d12 direct damage if the character traverses 1/2/3 zones respectively (a fall of 1 zone means that the character falls within the same zone).
Higher falls kill instantly.
Characters can cushion the fall by passing an AGI roll, reducing the effective falling distance by 1 zone.
Additionally, characters who jump down voluntarily always reduce the falling distance by 1 zone.


## Fear
Characters must pass a WIT roll to be able to approach something frightening to close range.
Conversely, if they start their activation within close range of something frightening, they must pass a WIT roll or be forced to move away from it.
If they can't, they are paralysed by fear and can't act.


## Fire
Fire inflicts direct damage.
Characters who end their activation in or leave a zone on fire suffer d6 fire damage.

As a round action, characters can attempt to **extinguish** fire in their zone by passing an AGI roll.
If they have some tools which can help, the roll isn't required.
At the end of each round, there is a 1:4 chance that a fire spreads from a zone to an adjacent one.


## Lightning
Lightning inflicts direct damage and spreads through conductive material, such as water, potentially hitting multiple characters.


## Poison
Each poison has a specific delivery method.
Victims automatically suffer its effects.
* **Ingestion**.
  Must be eaten or drunk.
  Can be mixed with food and drinks.
* **Inhalation**.
  Must be breathed for a few seconds.
  Can be thrown on the ground within close range, affecting all characters in a zone, but allowing them to resist with a STR roll.
* **Bloodstream**.
  Must enter the bloodstream.
  As a round action, characters can coat a weapon with it to grant it the *poison* property until the next scene.


## Suffocation
Characters can comfortably hold their breath for 4 rounds.
After that, they must pass a STR roll at the end of each activation or be *incapacitated* until the next scene.
While *incapacitated*, they must keep rolling and die on a second failed roll.


## Temperature
Heat and cold inflict direct damage.
Characters in a freezing cold or scorching hot environment suffer d4 cold or heat damage at the end of each stretch.


## Traps
Traps are secret features and as such can be detected by examining, searching, or sometimes passively.
Characters who detect a trap can stop before triggering it.
They can also choose to trigger it voluntarily, in which case they might be able to avoid it, typically by passing an AGI roll.
Characters who trigger an undetected trap can't escape its effect.
