## Attack action
As a round action, characters can **attack** a target, who suffers damage based on the weapon used.
Unarmed attacks inflict d4â€“1 damage.
Weapons held with the secondary hand inflict 1 less damage.
Weapons of bulk 3 or more must be used with both hands, but can be held with just one if unused.

**Melee attacks** target a nearby character.
**Ranged attacks** target a visible character within the indicated range, but can't be used after moving.


## Hitting
Attacks usually hit automatically, but passing a WIT roll is required to hit under challenging circumstances:
* If the target is nearby and isn't visible.
  Targets which aren't visible and are further away can't be attacked.
* If the target is at far or extreme range.


## Reacting
Characters who haven't activated yet during the current round can choose to perform a **reaction** in response to an attack.
Reactions must be declared after rolling to hit, but before rolling for damage.
* **Dodge**: the target of an attack can attempt to dodge.
If they pass an AGI roll, the attack misses and inflicts no damage.
* **Counter**: the target of an attack can **counter**, executing a suitable attack targeting the attacker and triggering a **duel**.
If the attack hits multiple targets, only one can counter.
* **Guard**: characters can **guard** a nearby ally who is targeted by an attack.
They become the new target and swap positions.

A reaction counts as the character's activation for the round, meaning that they can't activate again until the next round.
They also can't move or perform quick actions together with a reaction.


## Duels
Both characters involved in a duel roll for damage at the same time.
Whoever inflicts the most damage hits first, potentially killing or incapacitating the opponent before taking damage.
On a tie, both attacks land at the same time.
Attacks which inflict no damage hit last.
If both attacks inflict no damage, randomly determine which one hits first.


## Non-lethal attacks
Instead of inflicting damage, it is possible to perform one of the following non-lethal attacks:
* **Disarm**.
  A nearby character must pass a STR roll or drop a weapon chosen by the attacker, who can immediately take it if they have a free hand.
* **Shove**.
  A nearby character must pass a STR roll, otherwise the attacker can move with them up to a zone and then shove them into a nearby hazard.
* **Grab**.
  A nearby character must pass a STR roll or be *entangled* for as long as the attacker keeps hold.
  The attacker only needs one free hand to keep hold.


## Morale
Groups of characters must check for morale if they lost a member (killed or *incapacitated*) due to an attack and were reduced below half their original numbers (compared to the beginning of the scene).
Lone fighters must check for morale if they suffered damage from an attack and their health was reduced below half the maximum.

Each character who must check for morale makes a WIT roll at the end of the round.
Those who fail are forced to either flee or surrender to the enemy.
Those who pass are immune to morale until the next scene.
To speed things up, roll the d20 only once for each group, comparing the roll to the individual WIT scores.


## Attack properties
* **Blast**.
  Blast attacks target a zone and hit all characters within it.
  Melee blast attacks don't hit the attacker and can't miss.
  Ranged blast attacks also hit the attacker if directed at their zone, and if they miss they are deviated, hitting a random adjacent zone instead.
* **Direct damage**.
  The attack ignores armour.
* **Fire**/**Lightning**/**Heat**/**Cold**.
  The attack inflicts the indicated damage type.
* **Grab**.
  Characters can both inflict damage and attempt to grab the target.
  In a duel, the grab attack is resolved when damage is assigned.
* **Loud**.
  The attack is very loud and can be heard at extreme range.
  Animals within close range must pass a WIT roll or are spooked and must run away.
  Riders must pass an AGI roll to avoid falling.
* **Piercing**.
  If you roll higher than armour, the attack inflicts full damage.
  If you roll lower, damage is still reduced to 0.
* **Poison**.
  Anyone suffering at least 1 damage from the attack must pass a STR roll or suffer from the indicated poison effect.
* **Range**.
  This is a ranged attack which can be used within the listed range.
* **One shot**.
  The attack can only be used once per stretch.
* **Reload**.
  The weapon must be reloaded before using it again, which consumes a round action.


## Damage to weapons
Weapons are damaged when the maximum result on the damage die is rolled (triggering explosive damage).

Shields and armour are damaged by attacks inflicting 7 or more damage.
Shields take damage first.

Items are destroyed when damaged twice.
*Fragile* items are destroyed when damaged once, *robust* items when damaged 3 times.


## Improvised weapons
Characters can use any sharp or blunt object as an improvised weapon or shield.
Improvised weapons and shields are destroyed when damaged once.
* Sharp or blunt object of bulk 2 or less inflict d4 damage.
* Sharp or blunt object of bulk 3 or more inflict d6 damage, and must be used with two hands.
* Flat, sturdy objects can be used as an improvised shield.
* Sharp or blunt objects of bulk 1 can be thrown within close range, inflicting d4 damage.


## Damage to objects
Vehicles and other large objects have a structure score, which works like health for characters, and an armour value.
If structure drops to 0 or less, the object is destroyed beyond hope of repair.
If damage matches or exceeds half the maximum structure at once, the object suffers critical damage and can't fulfil its function until it recovers at least 1 structure.
