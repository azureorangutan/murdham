## Casting spells
As a round action, characters can **cast a spell** by reading a *sacred* or *arcane scroll* out loud.
Each scroll contains a single spell and can't be duplicated: they aren't simple pieces of parchment, and knowledge on how to craft them has been lost.
Reading from the scroll is required; it isn't possible to memorise the incantations: for unknown reasons, the human mind repels the memory.


## Spell level
Casters can enhance spells
to improve their range or duration by a category,
to double the number of targets,
or in other ways specific to each spell.
The same enhancement can be applied multiple times.
The **spell level** equals 1 plus the number of enhancements.


## Sacred spells
Sacred spells depend on the favour of the caster's divinity and are subject to their whims.
The caster must spend an omen and roll above current corruption plus twice the spell level on a d12; otherwise, the spell has no effect.


## Arcane spells
Arcane spells channel pure chaos and are extremely dangerous.
The caster automatically suffers corruption equal to twice the spell level.
If they suffer damage due to corruption, the power still works, but the caster must roll on the miscast table below, even if they are killed or *incapacitated*.
Re-roll if the result doesn't make sense or isn't applicable in the current situation.

|  D12  | Miscast                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :---: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | **Fumble**. The power doesn't work, but there are no other penalties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   2   | **Backfire**. The scroll is lost. D6: 1) it bursts into flames; 2) it crumbles to dust; 3) it disappears in a puff of smoke; 4) it is carried away by a terrible wind; 5) it melts and turns to blood; 6) it turns into blank parchment.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|   3   | **Uncanny event**. A frightening event happens around the caster. Everyone witnessing it must pass a WIT roll or be *incapacitated* until the end of their next activation as they are frozen in shock. D6: 1) nearby plants wither; 2) the ground turns into soft flesh; 3) black ash rains; 4) a disembodied, cruel laughter echoes in the wind; 5) spiders crawl out of the caster's mouth; 6) the visage of a terrible god flashes in the sky. |
|   4   | **Darkness**. Thick magical darkness or fog shrouds all zones within close range. It's impossible to see through it, and light cannot penetrate it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|   5   | **Corruption**. The floor, walls, and air around the caster twirl and change in chaotic patterns. All others within close range suffer 2 corruption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|   6   | **Explosion**. Black flames burst from the caster. All others in the same zone suffer d6 fire damage. They can dodge as if it were an attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|   7   | **Wrong target**. The power hits the wrong targets, in a way which is disadvantageous for the caster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   8   | **Alternative effect**. The power has an alternative effect which is disadvantageous for the caster, typically the exact opposite of what it was intended to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|   9   | **Blight**. The caster and all close characters are infected by a disease chosen by the GM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  10   | **Mutation**. The caster develops a mutation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  11   | **Summoning**. A demon enters the world from the caster's zone. It isn't necessarily hostile, but its presence will surely spell trouble at some point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  12   | **Possession**. The caster gains the *possessed* trait.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |


## Spell range
* **Touch** (default).
  The caster must touch the target.
  The spell works as a melee attack.
  It can be countered, dodged, and guarded against.
* **Sight**.
  The caster must see the target.
  The spell works as a ranged attack.
  It can be countered, but not dodged or guarded against.
* **Connection**.
  The target can be anywhere as long as the caster has an arcane connection to it.
  An arcane connection is formed by holding an object closely related to the target
  (a lock of hair, a personal possession, etc.), which is then destroyed.
  The spell doesn't work as an attack and can't be reacted to.

Casters can always target themselves, no matter what the spell range is.


## Spell duration
* **Fleeting** (default).
  Lasts until the end of the stretch.
* **Prolonged**.
  Lasts until the end of the watch.
* **Lingering**.
  Lasts indefinitely.

The caster may declare a trigger which ends the power prematurely (a word, a gesture, a trigger, etc.).
**Instantaneous** powers have an immediate effect and therefore no duration.


## Mana
Characters with the *sorcery* skill have a pool of mana.
When they cast an arcane spell, they reduce its power level by their current mana to determine how much corruption they suffer, even down to 0.
After the spell is cast, they lose 1 mana.
Mana is recovered by resting.


## Rituals
Characters can cast a spell as a ritual as stretch action rather than a round action.
This lets them apply a free enhancement without increasing the power level.
The spell targets must constantly be within range during the whole ritual, otherwise they are unaffected.
The caster may cancel a ritual casting at any moment, in which case they don't spend omens, mana, or suffer corruption.


## Dispelling
Characters may dispel an ongoing spell by casting it again on the same target.
This counts as casting with power level 1, 2, or 3 if the targeted spell has *fleeting*, *prolonged*, or *lingering* duration, respectively.
