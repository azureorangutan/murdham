# Changelog

## 2024.11.27

* Fixed a bug in the search functionality.
* Reduced the cost of a full rest to 32 shillings, plus extra cost if recovery from injuries is needed.
* Split cost for food and lodging in case of daily rests.
* Adjusted sprinting rules, and the _fleet-footed_ skill accordingly.
* Added mention on order of resolution when a non-lethal attack is countered by another non-lethal attack.
