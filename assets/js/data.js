export const skill_descriptions = {
  "acrobatics": "You can balance on rough surfaces without an AGI roll, and on very rough surfaces with an AGI roll. You can leap normal distances without an AGI roll, and twice that with an AGI roll. You can perform a number of acrobatic performance acts, such as trampoline, trapeze, aerial silk, etc.",
  "acting": "When you use a <i>disguise kit</i>, others can't notice passively with a WIT roll. You can accurately imitate the voice, accent, and mannerism of others. You can convincingly act like you belong to a certain role or social class (a guard, a priest, a noble, etc.), but you must pass a WIT roll if you don't look the part.",
  "alert": "You can react to traps and attackers you aren't aware of.",
  "ambidextrous": "You can use both hands equally well. Weapons held with the secondary hand inflict full damage. You can attack the same target with two weapons at once, rolling for damage with both but only taking the higher roll.",
  "animal handling": "You can have 2 additional animal followers. You can befriend an animal by offering some food or care and passing a WIT roll. It acts as your follower until the next watch or you leave its territory. Once per downtime, you can tame a wild animal or train an animal follower at something (work, fight, hunt, tricks, etc.).",
  "apothecary": "As a round action, you can craft a medicinal item, poison or drug, which spoils if not used by the end of the stretch. You can't do it again until you rest. If you carry an <i>apothecary kit</i>, you can use this skill twice between rests.",
  "bargaining": "When you <i>visit a market</i> as a watch action, you may buy a single item at half price. You pay half for meals, lodging, and downtime. You can accurately estimate the value of something by looking at it.",
  "battle frenzy": "You may become <i>frenzied</i> when you suffer damage or by spending a round action inciting yourself into a frothing rage. You may also attempt to calm yourself and clear the <i>frenzied</i> affliction at the end of your activation by passing a WIT roll. While <i>frenzied</i>, you are immune to fear and morale, you aren't <i>incapacitated</i> by critical damage, and you recover 1 health each time you <i>incapacitate</i> or kill someone.",
  "blather": "You can speak endless strings of nonsense, leaving others dumbfounded. When you talk, you may automatically distract someone. On following rounds, they lose interest if they pass a WIT roll.",
  "boating": "You can safely drive a boat in most challenging circumstances without a WIT roll. You are able to operate sailing boats.",
  "brave": "You are immune to fear and morale.",
  "brawling": "Your unarmed attacks inflict d6 damage. You have an innate armour value of 1 against unarmed attacks, which doesn't stack with worn armour.",
  "burglary": "You can pick locks with <i>lockpicks</i> without a WIT roll. You can also attempt to pick common locks without <i>lockpicks</i>, or very advanced locks, with a WIT roll. You can automatically detect traps which aren't well concealed without a WIT roll.",
  "bushcraft": "You can't get lost when pathfinding. When you forage, you roll twice and keep both results. You can easily find or build shelter: your company can always sleep well even under precipitation or in cold weather.",
  "charm": "You can attempt to improve the attitude of someone you talk with by passing a WIT roll. You may only attempt once per character.",
  "cleave": "Once per round, when you inflict critical damage with a melee attack, you may immediately attack another target with the same weapon.",
  "climbing": "You can climb challenging surfaces without an AGI roll, and almost impossible ones with an AGI roll. You always reduce falling distances by an additional zone.",
  "consume alcohol": "You don't become <i>groggy</i> by consuming alcohol. You can instantly recognise if something is wrong with a drink, for example if it has been poisoned.",
  "contortionist": "Your joints are extremely flexible and you can bend your body in absurd shapes. You can squeeze through small openings and easily escape bonds. When you would get the <i>disabled arm</i> or <i>disabled leg</i> affliction from an injury, there is a 1:4 chance you don't get it.",
  "crafting": "You are able to craft 4 types of items. You don't have to choose immediately; you can pick them at any moment. Crafting an item is a watch action, requires access to a <i>workshop</i>, and costs ¼ the item's value in raw materials. If it's a consumable item, you can craft a batch of 4 at once. You can use a <i>repair kit</i> without a STR roll on items you can craft. You can also attempt repairs without a kit with a STR roll.",
  "darksight": "You can see one zone further in areas illuminated by a dim light source, such as a <i>candle</i>, <i>oil lamp</i>, or <i>torch</i>. Your melee attacks hit automatically even when you can't see your target. In general, the GM might let you ignore penalties related to darkness or dim lighting when deemed appropriate.",
  "disarm": "Targets of your disarm attacks can't resist with a STR roll unless they also have this skill. You can only be disarmed by characters with this skill.",
  "disease resistance": "You only need half the normal amount of successive STR roll successes to recover from disease (typically only 1).",
  "divination": "You can spend a stretch and an omen to ritually sacrifice an animal and interpret its entrails. Ask a question about the past, present, or future. The GM describes a vision giving you a cryptic answer. There is a 1:8 chance that it is false or misleading, rolled secretly by the GM. If you have a <i>divination kit</i>, you can use this skill without sacrificing an animal.",
  "dodge blows": "You can dodge an attack without spending your turn once per round.",
  "drive carts": "You can safely drive a cart in most challenging circumstances without a WIT roll.",
  "dueling": "You always hit first in a duel unless your opponent also has this skill.",
  "erudite": "You are an expert in all forms of academic lore: history, geography, beasts, law, plants, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, theology, sorcery, etc. You may ask the GM for further information concerning such topics.",
  "faithful": "Your deity looks kindly upon you. When you attempt to cast a sacred power, you roll a d20 instead of a d12 to determine if you are successful. However, you must rigidly obey your deity's commandments or lose this advantage.",
  "farming": "When you forage, you find an additional <i>perishable ration</i> on a <i>fruits and vegetables</i> result. You can milk animals for a <i>perishable ration</i> during a rest. When you butcher an animal, you get twice the normal amounts of rations.",
  "fire-eating": "You reduce fire damage by 1. You can spit an <i>alcoholic drink</i> through an open flame, such as a lit <i>torch</i>, to make a melee attack targeting up to 2 enemies and inflicting d6 fire damage. You are able to perform tricks using burning sticks, such as extinguishing them with your tongue, juggling them, etc.",
  "fishing": "When you forage, on a <i>fish</i> result you get 2 additional <i>perishable rations</i>.",
  "fleet-footed": "When you take a rush action, you move 2 additional zones instead of 1. You can't be pinned.",
  "frugal": "When you rest, you recover health, mana, and 1 point in an ability score even if you don't satisfy all daily needs. However, you still reduce ability scores if you don't.",
  "gambling": "You know how to cheat at games. If you describe a reasonable way to cheat, you can automatically win or lose. Others might still get suspicious if you are too successful. The GM should roll secretly for their characters when playing games, to avoid showing if they are cheating.",
  "gossip": "Every time you perform an action in town, be it visiting a market, resting, or anything else, you hear some interesting rumour from the GM. It might not be true.",
  "heal": "You can use a surgery kit without a WIT roll. You can also attempt surgeries without a kit, or almost impossible surgeries, with a WIT roll. You can use <i>healing kits</i> more effectively: you restore d8 health (up to half the maximum) as a round action, or half the maximum health as a stretch action.",
  "hunt": "You can follow trails without a WIT roll, and almost invisible trails with a WIT roll. When you forage, on a <i>critters</i> result you gain an additional <i>perishable ration</i>. When you butcher an animal, you also gain a <i>trophy</i>.",
  "incorruptible": "You halve any amount of corruption you suffer, except from casting arcane powers.",
  "intimidate": "Characters can't resist your intimidations with a WIT roll. The first time you kill someone in a fight, you trigger a morale check for enemies within close range. This is in addition to the usual morale check.",
  "languages": "You can speak 4 additional languages. You don't have to pick immediately, you can choose them at any moment.",
  "leadership": "You can be accompanied by 2 additional human followers. Before your faction makes a morale check, you make a WIT roll. If you pass, they skip the morale check. However, if you are later <i>incapacitated</i> or killed during the fight, your faction must then make the morale check you prevented.",
  "literate": "You can read and write any language you can speak, as well as perform calculations more complex than what you can count on your fingers.",
  "lucky": "You have 1 additional omen. You recover 1 omen when you rest. You can spend advances to increase your omens by 1 (maximum 6).",
  "magic sense": "You can meditate to detect the presence of magic (ongoing spells, demons, magical creatures, relics, etc.) in the vicinity. As a round action, you can detect if magic is present in your zone. As a stretch action, you can detect if magic is present in the site. You can only detect if magic is present, you can't locate its source or determine its nature.",
  "magic shield": "You can use an ancient technique to erect a magic shield around you. Activating or deactivating it is a stretch action, and it is removed automatically if you are <i>incapacitated</i> or killed. Arcane powers have a 1:2 chance of not working on you, no matter if harmful or beneficial. Other targets are unaffected. The caster can enhance the spell to ignore the effect of a magic shield",
  "medicine": "As a round action, you may accurately diagnose a disease, poison, or drug. This can help choose a suitable cure or antidote, and can provide information about possible future effects.",
  "monster slaying": "You inflict half damage, rather than a quarter damage, to huge characters.",
  "pack rat": "You are only encumbered when you carry over 12 bulk (instead of 8).",
  "piercing strike": "Your attacks with weapons gain the <i>piercing</i> property: if you roll higher than armour, the attack inflicts full damage. If you roll lower, damage is still reduced to 0. This skill doesn't work with unarmed attacks, blast attacks, and when you must pass a WIT roll to hit, as it requires full precision.",
  "play games": "After playing a game once, you become extremely good at it. Others can't beat you unless they also have this skill. This skill, however, doesn't apply to games based on pure luck.",
  "poison resistance": "You ignore the first dose of poison you take each stretch.",
  "protect": "You can guard without spending your turn any number of times.",
  "ride": "You automatically pass AGI rolls to avoid falling from your mount, and your attacks aren't impaired while mounted. You can ride an untrained animal or without a <i>saddle</i>, but then you lose the benefits of this skill.",
  "saint": "You can cast a specific sacred power without a scroll and with one free enhancement. All other spell casting rules apply as usual. You can get this skill multiple times, each time for a new power.",
  "shield mastery": "When you hold a <i>shield</i>, your armour value is increased by 1 against all attacks, not just if you react or duel.",
  "skilled blow": "You improve the damage die of melee attacks (excluding unarmed attacks): d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12. You can't improve a d12. If the attack has multiple targets, only one takes increased damage.",
  "skilled shot": "You improve the damage die of ranged attacks: d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12. You can't improve a d12. If the attack has multiple targets, only one takes increased damage.",
  "sneak attack": "When you attack an unaware enemy, roll an additional d12 damage die and keep the higher roll.",
  "sorcery": "You have a pool of mana, which you can use to cast unclean powers more effectively as described in the Magic section. You start with 1 mana. You can spend advances to increase your mana by 1 (maximum 6).",
  "steady aim": "You can make a ranged attack after moving. If you are stationary, you automatically hit even at far range.",
  "stealing": "You can steal without alerting your victim without an AGI roll.",
  "stealth": "You can move silently without an AGI roll in challenging situations. You can also attempt to sneak in extremely hard situations with an AGI roll.",
  "storytelling": "When you stage a music performance or tell a tale, others must pass a WIT roll or be captivated and distracted by you. On a rest, you can perform for your companions. Each one has a 1:4 chance of recovering a spent omen. If you use a <i>music instrument</i>, the chance increases to 1:2.",
  "strike to injure": "When you inflict critical damage, you may choose to injure or kill the target. You choose what injury to apply instead of rolling on the table (it must still make somewhat sense), and if it is permanent or temporary.",
  "strike to stun": "When you attack with a blunt weapon (a cudgel, the pommel of a sword, a rock, etc.) you may choose to reduce damage by any amount, for example to avoid killing your target.",
  "swimming": "You can swim in challenging circumstances without an AGI roll, and in almost impossible circumstances with an AGI roll. You can safely hold your breath for twice as long (8 rounds).",
  "taunt": "You know how to pull the right strings to make others mad at you. As a round action, you may taunt someone. They must pass a WIT roll or be forced to act aggressively towards you. In a fight, they must try to attack you, ignoring everyone else.",
  "tough": "Your maximum health is increased by 3 (it equals STR+3).",
  "true grit": "When you are reduced to 0 health, you can survive until the end of the stretch rather than until the end of your next activation.",
  "use poison": "You don't risk accidentally poisoning yourself when using poison.",
  "witchcraft": "You can cast a specific arcane power without a scroll and with one free enhancement. All other spell casting rules apply as usual. You can get this skill multiple times, each time for a new power.",
  "wrestling": "Targets of your shove and grapple attacks can't resist with a STR roll unless they also have this skill. You can only be shoved or grappled by characters with this skill.",
