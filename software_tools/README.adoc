A collection of software tools for Murdham RPG.


== Rulebook generation

Some parts of the rules are autogenerated from Rust code.

----
$ cd software tools
$ cargo run -p gen_rules -- -o ../pages/rulebook/sections/gen

$ mkdir out
$ cargo run -p gen_character -- -n 4 -o ../out/characters.adoc
----
