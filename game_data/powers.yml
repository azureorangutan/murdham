profane powers:
- name: animal shape
  descr: Target a _creature_, who turns into a medium-sized animal of your choice. You must carry the skin, feathers, scales, or shell of the chosen animal, which envelop and merge with the target during the transformation and returns to its previous state when the spell ends. The target keeps WIT and intelligence level, but can't speak. The spell doesn't influence the target's equipment, which simply falls to the ground.

  duration: Stretch
- name: eldritch blast
  descr: Target a character or an item. The target is hit by a force blast, which works as a melee attack, inflicting d10 damage (impaired against items). If you enhance the power to _sight_ range, it works as a ranged attack instead. All skills and rules concerning attacks apply, and the attack can be dodged or countered as usual. If you enhance the power to _connection_ range, the blast is conjured on top of the target and your skills don't apply any longer, but the target can still dodge.

- name: fiery taste
  descr: 'Target up to 4 _rations_ and/or _alcoholic drinks_. _Rations_ become extremely spicy: those who consume must pass a STR save or succumb to a terrible stomachache and be _incapacitated_ until the end of the stretch. _Alcoholic drinks_ become extremely potent: drinking one counts as drinking two. Characters with the _fire eating_ skill aren''t affected.'
  range: Near
  duration: Stretch
- name: flawed resurrection
  descr: Target the lifeless heart of a _creature_ who died no longer than a stretch ago. A new body forms around the heart and the target's spirit is called back to inhabit it, effectively resurrecting them. The regeneration process takes a day and the new body is different from the original both in appearance and capabilities. STR and AGI are equal to the average (8 for humans, what's indicated in their profile for other creatures) minus d3. WIT, skills, intelligence, and personality don't change. Once the resurrection is complete, the target immediately suffers 4 corruption.

You can attempt to discharge it by touching another creature before the power ends. The target can resist the infection with a STR save.

If the power ends before you discharge the disease, you are infected by it yourself, without chance of a save.
  range: Near
  duration: Stretch
  enhancements:
  - - 1
    - Target another creature, who replaces you as the carrier of the disease.
