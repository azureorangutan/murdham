arcane spells:
- name: Astro's Magnificent Lock
  descr: >-
    Target an item which can be opened and closed (a door, a box, etc.).
    The target is locked and can only be opened by a trigger of your choice (a special key, a password, a gesture, etc.).
    It can still be broken.
    The nature of this spell is unknown,
    but some posit that it conjures an invisible demon holding the object closed.
  enhancements:
  - The target emits a loud scream if someone attempts to open or break it.
- name: Awaken the Eternal Servant
  descr: >-
    Target the corpse of a tiny or medium creature.
    It is raised as an undead.
    It keeps its STR, halves AGI and WIT, loses all skills, and gains the *undead* and *frenzied* traits.
    The corpse is only driven by the desire to destroy the living, but won't turn against you.
    It is impossible to raise the same corpse again after it has been destroyed.
  enhancements:
  - You can target the corpse of a huge creature.
  - The corpse retains the intelligence it had in life.
    It maintains its WIT score and skills, and doesn't acquire *frenzied*.
    It still can't harm you, but might not like its current condition...
- name: Bestial Metamorphosis
  descr: >-
    Target a person.
    The target's bones and flesh are painfully rearranged, turning them into an animal at the end of their next activation.
    Until then, they are unable to act.
    They retain their intelligence, but can't speak, and their gear falls to the ground.
    Every individual always turns into the same beast, their spirit animal.
    The GM picks one or rolls a d12:
    1) cat;
    2) small dog;
    3) light horse;
    4) mule;
    5) sheep;
    6) bat;
    7) rat;
    8) wolf;
    9) boar;
    10) deer;
    11) hawk;
    12) viper.
  enhancements:
  - The target retains the ability to speak.
  - If you carry an *animal trophy*, you can turn the target into that specific animal instead of their spirit animal.
    The trophy merges with the target for the duration of the spell.
- name: Bewitch
  descr: >-
    Target a creature.
    The target becomes infatuated with you.
    They are extremely friendly, but also rather obsessive.
    They keep their free will and won't be easily convinced to do something harmful or against their morals.
    The spell ends prematurely if you hurt them or take advantage of them.
  enhancements:
  - The target is compelled to obey, without question, one single request coming from you,
    triggered by a sentence pattern of your choice.
    However, this will break the spell after their next activation.
- name: Blessing of the Deep One
  descr: >-
    Target a creature.

  enhancements:
  - The target also gains the ability to communicate with water creatures.
- name: Burning Fire of Vengeance
  descr: >-
    Target a person, name someone who wronged or offended them, even slightly, and remind them how.
    The target's blood boils with anger,
    and they become obsessed with an irrational desire to take revenge by killing the named person.
    If they are in their presence, they will do what they can to harm them.
  enhancements:
  - The target becomes so obsessed that they will hunt and seek the named person, no matter where they are.
- name: Chaotic Miasma of Change
  descr: >-
    Target a zone.
    A twirling, multi-coloured mist raises from the ground within it.
    It blocks visibility, and characters who exit or end their activation in the mist suffer 2 corruption.
    Plants and even inanimate objects also change in weird ways.
  enhancements:
  - Double the amount of corruption.
  - The mist covers all zones within range 1 of the targeted one.
    Enhance multiple times to double the range.
- name: Damnable Conjuration of Morkarr
  descr: >-
    Target a zone.
    You open a dark portal to the Netherworld within it, just long enough for a demon to step through it.
    The demon isn't under your control and behaves according to its own desires.
    It will be banished back when the spell ends, or whenever it wishes to return itself.
    You can summon a specific demon by calling its name; otherwise, the GM chooses.
  enhancements:
  - Draw a circle on the ground.
    The summoned demon is bound within its boundaries until it accepts a bargain with you.
    The demon might refuse or try to negotiate.
- name: Deathly Curse of Tramar
  descr: >-
    Instantaneous.
    The range of this spell can't be enhanced; it is always centred on the caster.
    All living, tiny creatures within close range and who can hear the curse must pass a group STR roll or die.
    The caster, demons, and undead are unaffected.
  enhancements:
  - The spell works one zone further.
  - The spell also affects medium-sized creatures.
    Enhance a second time to also affect huge creatures.

    The target is paralysed and falls to the ground like a stringless puppet.

    but must still breathe and will suffer from hunger and thirst.
    The spell ends if the target is hurt.
  enhancements:
  - The target doesn't have to eat or drink while under the influence of this spell.
  - The target is able to perceive what happens around them while under the influence of this spell.
- name: Doom Covenant
  descr: >-
    Target a person with whom you want to seal a bargain.
    You summon a demon to bear witness and act as a guarantor:
    it will punish whoever breaks the deal while under the influence of this spell.
    The nature of the punishment is decided by the demon: it might be death, possession, one's soul, etc.
    You can summon a specific demon by calling its name; otherwise, the GM chooses.
  enhancements:
  - You can't be punished even if you break the bargain.
    However, there is a 1:4 chance that the demon will find a loophole and will still be able to.
- name: Dreadful Leech
  descr: >-
    Instantaneous.
    Target a creature.

    This spell can be evaded and guarded against also at *sight* range.
  enhancements:
  - Your attack gains the *grab* property.
    If you do grab the target, you can pull them towards you, and you can keep inflicting damage with this spell while you keep hold as your round action.
- name: Flawed Resurrection of Görst
  descr: >-
    Instantaneous.
    Target the lifeless heart of a creature who died during the current stretch.
    A new body slowly forms around it by the end of the stretch, and the target's spirit is called back to inhabit it, effectively resurrecting them.
    The new body, however, is different from the original in appearance and capabilities.
    Reassign STR, AGI, and WIT randomly, as done during character creation.
    Skills, memories, and personality don't change, but physical traits such as permanent injuries or mutations are lost.
  enhancements:
  - You can target someone who died on this day.
    Further enhancements add another day.
- name: Mindworm
  descr: >-
    Target a creature.
    You are able to perceive what they perceive.
    However, you are unaware of what happens around your own body, which appears to be locked in deep meditation.
    You can voluntarily go back to your body, but only if you are within the range at which you cast the spell.
  enhancements:
  - You can also telepathically communicate with the target.
- name: Mirtello's Most Excellent Illusion
  descr: >-
    Target a zone.
    You create an illusion within its boundaries, which can affect one sense (sight, hearing, or smell, but not touch).
    While you are within range, you can concentrate on the illusion to change or animate it.
    When you stop, the illusion remains frozen in the state you left it.
  enhancements:
  - You can make the illusion animate in a loop by itself.
  - The illusion can affect another sense.
- name: Occult Consultation
  descr: >-
    Instantaneous.
    Target the remains of a person who died during the current scene, whose spirit is still lingering in the area.
    You may ask the spirit one question, but they aren't forced to answer truthfully, if at all.
    If you enhance the spell's range to *connection*, you may contact the spirit of a long-dead person.
    In this case, they can only answer by knocking on the door to the underworld:
    the answer can be yes-or-no (knock once or twice) or a number.
  enhancements:
  - The target can't lie, but they can still choose not to answer.
  - Double the number of questions you may ask.
- name: Pankratius's Blast of Vengeance

  enhancements:
  - >-
    You empower the disease with the blessing of the Rot God.
    *Cures* don't work against it, only natural recovery or magic.

- name: Swift Chariot of the Winds
  descr: >-
    Target a creature.
    The target is raised by the wind, gaining the *flying* trait.

  - The target also gets the *fast* trait while flying.
