== Maximum omens

Omens represent luck and divine favour.
Player characters have a maximum of 2 omens, which can rarely be modified by skills and other effects.
GM characters normally don't have any omens, but exceptions can be made for particularly important individuals.


== Spending omens

* Reroll a failed save.
You can even do so when you fail a group save, in which case you reroll the die only for yourself, other characters are unaffected.

* Reroll a contest against the character just above you in the ranking, swapping positions if you win.
If multiple characters have omens to spend, those at the bottom spend their omens first.

* Reroll the die when you suffer damage, keeping the lowest roll.
You can't reroll damage you inflict.

* Reroll the d12 when you must determine if you suffer soulblight after taking corruption, keeping the result you prefer.

* Reroll on a table, picking the result you prefer.

* Save yourself from death.
Your health is restored to 1, but you still suffer critical damage and you must roll on the link:../health_and_damage/#tb_injuries[Injuries] table.
In this case, the effect of the injury is permanent!


== Honour the dead

When a Player character dies, the other characters must pay for a funeral at the latest on their next full rest.
It costs 512Ê‚, halved if the dead character's body is returned.

Failing to pay for a funeral is bad luck: all other Player characters permanently reduce their maximum omens by 1.
If they already have 0 omens, they suffer no additional penalties.
