== Detection

When two groups encounter each other they must each make a group WIT save.
If at least one member passes, they notice the other group.

Groups which are being reckless (making noise, talking loudly, carrying a light in the dark, etc.) are automatically detected and can't detect the other group unless they are being reckless as well.
Groups which are well hidden and silent can't be detected by a WIT save, only by a search, and automatically detect even cautious groups.

If only one group notices the other, it has the opportunity to decide how to approach the encounter: leaving, sneaking, launching an ambush, attempting to parley, etc.
If both or neither group notices the other, the two sides stumble upon each other and the encounter can't be avoided.


== Attitude

The GM can use the following levels to express the attitude that other characters have towards the Player characters:

* *Hostile* characters actively try to harm the Player characters.

* *Unfriendly* characters refuse to cooperate with the Player characters, but won't go out of their way to harm them.

* *Neutral* characters just do what's best for them.
They are open to mutually beneficial deals.

* *Friendly* characters are open to help and do favours.
They will still expect to get something back at some point.

* *Infatuated* characters will be extremely friendly to the Player characters, often doing favours in exchange for little or nothing.
They still won't do something which will harm them, and if they start feeling they are taken advantage of their attitude might worsen.



== Diplomacy

Characters who try to use diplomacy on others must pass a WIT save to determine if they are charismatic enough to succeed.
The following are typical diplomacy attempts:

* *Befriending*.
Perform a friendly activity (do a favour, give a present, buy some drinks, etc.) and pass a WIT save to improve a character's attitude towards you.
In case a big favour is made the save is not required.

* *Inspiring*.
Appeal to someone's emotions or provide them with incentives (payments, favours, etc.) and pass a WIT save to convince them to do something.
If the inspiration attempt is particularly effective or the incentives are very generous, the save is not required.

* *Persuading*.
Provide convincing arguments and pass a WIT save to persuade a character of something they aren't inclined to believe, no matter if the truth or a lie.
If the arguments are particularly solid and supported by evidence the save is not required.


== Manipulating

Characters who are being manipulated must pass a WIT save to determine if they are wilful enough to resist.
The following are typical manipulation attempts:

* *Distracting*.
Perform a distracting activity (play music, start a conversation, make noise, etc.) to distract a character from something else.
The target can figure out they are being distracted with a WIT save unless the attempt is particularly effective.
Distracting someone in combat is a main action, and if successful the target loses their next turn.

* *Intimidating*.
Use threats and leverage to force a character to do or say something.
The target can attempt to resist by passing a WIT save unless it is quite evident that you are capable and willing to act on your threats and that they would have no chance to oppose you.
Intimidating someone in combat is a main action, and if successful the target is _frightened_ by you.

* *Taunting*.
Use insults and provocations and pass a WIT save to manipulate a character into acting aggressively and impulsively.
The target can attempt to resist by passing a WIT save unless your taunts are really pulling the right strings.
Taunting someone in combat is a main action, and if successful the target can only spend their next turn trying to harm you.

* *Torturing*.
Torturing an imprisoned character takes a stretch of time and inflicts d6 direct damage.
The target, if still alive and conscious, must pass a WIT save or give up and talk.


== Playing games

A game is resolved as an ability contest, usually WIT or AGI.
Luck-based games are resolved with a d20 roll, with the winner being whoever rolls lowest.

Cheating requires declaring how the attempt is made and passing a WIT save to avoid detection.
The GM should roll the d20 secretly for their characters to avoid giving away if they are cheating: if they play honestly it is their contest roll, if they are cheating it is their WIT save to avoid detection.


== Stealing

Stealing an item with bulk Â½ from a nearby character requires passing an AGI save to avoid detection.
Stealing larger items is normally impossible.
Approaching the target without being noticed might require an additional AGI save to sneak without being detected.


== Trading

Goods can be purchased in exchange of something of at least equal value.
The value of items is indicated on their profile.
The value of less tangible assets, such as favours and peculiar services, must be adjudicated by the GM.

* Professional merchants want to make a profit and will only buy at half value.

* Second hand items, such as most gear owned or looted by the Player characters, are worth half.

* Damaged items are worth nothing.

* Goods in high demand are worth double or quadruple, while those in low demand are worth half or a quarter.

* Illegal goods are sold at one quarter of their value and bought at four times their value, and not everyone will be willing to trade at all.


== Gathering rumours

Player characters can spend a watch in a settlement to talk with the locals and hear interesting rumours.
The GM decides what they hear, and it might not necessarily be true.
