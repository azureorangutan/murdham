== Creating a character

. Roll on the <<tb_starting_ability_scores>> to determine an array of three scores and assign them randomly to the three abilities.
Roll a d3 to assign the highest score: 1) STR; 2) AGI; 3) WIT.
Roll a d2 to assign the middle score to one of the remaining abilities, skipping over the one which was already assigned.
Finally assign the lowest score to the last remaining ability.

. Determine your background by rolling on the <<tb_backgrounds>> table.
Read about it in the link:../backgrounds[Backgrounds] section.
Reroll if you get the same background as another Player.

. A few backgrounds increase two abilities by 1.
Adjust their scores if that's the case.

. You start with one or two skills granted by your background.
You can read what they do in the link:../skills[Skills] section.

. You start with health equal to your STR, 0 corruption, and 2 omens.
You also start with 0 mana unless your background is _wizard_, in which case you start with 1 mana.
What these values mean is described later in the book.

. You start with d8Ê‚, the assets granted by your background, and the items and money you get by rolling once on each of the <<tb_starting_weapons>> and <<tb_starting_items>> tables.
Reroll if you get the same result as another Player on these tables.
You also share a single _candle_ and _flint & tinder_ with the other Player characters.
If you start with a _power scroll_ without a specified power, roll for it on the <<tb_sorcerous_powers>> or <<tb_sacred_powers>> tables.
You can read what your assets and powers do in the link:../assets[Assets] and link:../powers[Powers] section.

. Portray your character using words, drawings, or a combination of the two, as you prefer.
You can roll on the <<tb_appearance>>, <<tb_personality>>, and <<tb_reason_to_adventure>> tables if you need inspiration.

. Pick a suitable name, or roll on the <<tb_masculine_names>>, <<tb_feminine_names>>, and <<tb_last_names>> table to generate it randomly.

After all characters have been created, describe how they know each other.
You can roll on the <<tb_relationships>> table if you need inspiration.
You don't have to do this for every possible pair of characters, but you should make sure that everyone is connected.
You can go around the table and define a connection for each couple of Players sitting next to each other, excluding the last couple.

== Character advancement

During a campaign, you might be granted an advancement by the GM after you and the other Players achieve significant progress.

At odd advancements (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) you permanently increase your abilities by a total of 2 points, but no ability can exceed 15.
At even advancements (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.) you gain a new skill of your choice, but you must be able to reasonably explain how you have learnt it (a mentor, past experiences, etc.).

After 10 advancements you have reached the pinnacle of your potential and don't gain these benefits any longer.
Instead, if you advance again, you may either replace a skill or redistribute 2 points among your abilities.


== Granting advancements

The GM decides when the Player characters advance depending on how they are managing the campaign.

* *Scenarios*.
Grant a new advancement upon reaching the goals of a scenario, or of a few scenarios if you want to slow things down.
This method is well suited for episodic campaigns made of a sequence of distinct scenarios.

* *Milestones*.
Grant a new advancement upon completing a significant task or reaching a milestone in the campaign.
This method is well suited for sandbox campaigns where the separation between scenarios is not clear cut.

* *Experience for money*.
The Player characters earn experience points by spending money, at a rate of one experience point per shilling, and advance after gathering specific amounts of experience points.
Money spent in this way is lost and can't be retrieved in any way: it is stashed away for retirement, wasted carousing, donated to a good cause, etc.
The <<tb_experience_and_advancements>> table shows the amount of experience point required to reach certain advancements, but feel free to modify it based on your requirements.
This method is well suited for campaigns where the main goal is gathering treasure.
