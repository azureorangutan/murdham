Introducing Murdham, a role-playing game of perilous adventures in a fantasy world.
<!--more-->


## What's Murdham?

Murdham is a role-playing game of perilous adventures in a fantasy world, combining the atmosphere of old school British role-playing games with light and streamlined rules.

The rules and additional materials are freely available on this website for you to learn and play the game!
Note that I’m still playtesting it and refining the text of the rules: mostly minor modifications, and potentially some additional content.
For most major changes, stay tuned for updates on this blog.


## Streamlined rules

Many role-playing games have extremely elaborate and complex rules, which are in my opinion unacceptably slow to play in practice. Needing a whole game session just to create the Player characters or spending hours to resolve a fight are a no-go for me.
This is even worse from the Game Master’s perspective: referencing stat-blocks taking half a page feels more like a chore than anything else.

Other games have tried to correct this, but often fall on the other side of the spectrum: they provide a very bare-bones framework and rely on the experience of the game master to successfully run the game.
It is sometimes hard to parse how the designer envisioned them to be played.

My main goal with Murdham was to strike a balance between these two extremes: a game which is fast and snappy, but still feels like a solid game and not just a set of guidelines.
It’s certainly not the only game that tries to do this, but this is my attempt at it.


## The tone of the game

Setting-wise, Murdham tries to reproduce the feeling of certain old-school British role-playing games, without being tightly coupled to them.
The world is vaguely inspired by late mediaeval Europe, filled with terrible monsters, evil sorcerers, dark magic, and ancient evils.
The Player characters are common folks trying their best to survive, not powerful heroes.
You will not play as a paladin or a mighty warrior, more likely as a beggar or a ruined noble.
Combat is deadly, magic is dangerous, peril lurks behind every corner, friendships are short-lived, and in the end the Players’ ingenuity is the only tool they have to survive and succeed.
