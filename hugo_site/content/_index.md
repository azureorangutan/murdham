  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Old-School Roleplay"
    subtitle="The game relies on the Game Master to adjudicate the outcome of the Players' actions, using the rules as a toolbox. The Players must use their ingenuity and take advantage of their skills and gear to overcome the challenges they meet."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Streamlined and concise"
    subtitle="The rules strive to be as straightforward, intuitive, and brief as possible. No need to study a thick rulebook, memorise monster profiles taking whole pages, or reference the rulebook constantly."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Exhaustive rules"
    subtitle="The game provides guidelines on how to handle common situations found in a fantasy adventure game: exploration, travel, social interactions, stealth, combat, magic, vehicle, and more! Ideal for inexperienced Game Masters." >}}

  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Deadly adventures"
    subtitle="Death is always behind the corner. The Player characters are common folks and every fight or challenge they face could be their last. Characters become more skilful as they gain experience but don't turn into invincible heroes."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Simple yet deep combat"
    subtitle="Combat rules are streamlined yet deep. Turns move quickly and fights are over soon, but every turn is full of nail-biting decisions. An alternating activation system and a reaction mechanic make sure that every Player is always involved."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Vile sorcery and sacred prayers"
    subtitle="Two types of magic: sorcerous and sacred. Sorcerers have a pool of mana they can spend to cast spells safely, but can push themselves at the cost of corruption, risking miscasts and mutation. Sacred powers are safe, but can be used scarcely and might fizzle if the caster is corrupted."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Fast action resolution"
    subtitle="Just roll a d20 under an ability score. No modifiers, target numbers, or dice pools. Difficulty just comes in three steps: trivial (no roll, you just do it), challenging (roll to succeed), impossible (you just canâ€™t do it)."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Streamlined skill system"
    subtitle="Skills are keywords: a character either has them or they don't. They provide significant advantages, such as the ability to succeed in certain actions without rolling or to cast spells."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Gear without book-keeping"
    subtitle="Characters can carry a limited amount of gear, tracked with a slot-based inventory system requiring very little math and book-keeping. Items are described in a few words and all have a clear use within the game."
