== Handling traits

Traits are characteristics which, unlike skills, are either innate or acquired in ways other than training and learning.
Unlike skills, they can also be disadvantageous.
Apart from that, they work in a similar way: their description lists common effect, but you should take them into account any time it makes sense.
