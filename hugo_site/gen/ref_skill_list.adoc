This requires suitable ingredients and _apothecary tools_. Creating a single dose takes only a stretch of time, but ingredients are rare. It takes a watch to gather them in the wilderness (if they are locally present), or to find them for sale in a settlement (they are worth ¼ the value of the end product).

* *Magic shield*.
You can use an ancient esoteric technique to erect a magic shield around you. Activating or deactivating it takes a stretch spent in meditation, and it deactivates automatically if you are _incapacitated_ or fall asleep. Profane powers have a 1:2 chance of not working on you, no matter if harmful or beneficial. Other targets aren't protected and sacred powers aren't affected. Sorcerers can spend 1 enhancement point to ignore the shield.

* *Medicine*.

* *Play games*.
You can learn to play games quickly: after you have played a game, you can't be beaten by others unless they also have this skill. You know how to cheat: your cheating attempts are always successful unless your opponents are paying close attention to you. People might still get suspicious if you win too much.

* *Steady aim*.
You double the range of ranged attacks.

* *Steal*.
Reduce difficulty while stealing, or attempt to steal an item with bulk 1 instead of ½.

When you inflict critical damage, you may choose to injure or kill the target. You choose what injury to apply instead of rolling on the table (it must still make somewhat sense), and you may choose that it is permanent rather than temporary.

* *Strike to stun*.
When you attack with a blunt weapon (a cudgel, the pommel of a sword, a rock...) you may choose to inflict no damage.
