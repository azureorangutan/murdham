* **Arm injury**.
You can't use one of your arms.


* **Bleeding**.
You suffer d4 direct damage at the end of each stretch. You recover if you roll 4 or more damage, or as soon as your wounds are stitched up using _surgical tools_.


* **Blind**.
You can't see. You can't notice anything by sight alone, your melee attacks require passing a WIT save to hit, and you can't use ranged attacks.


* **Deaf**.
You can't hear. You can't notice anything based on sound alone, and you might have trouble communicating with others and noticing ambushes.


* **Dying**.
You die at the end of the next round, unless you recover 1 health before then. If you do, you are stabilized but suffer an injury.


* **Entangled**.
You are unable to act. You can make an attempt to break free each round by passing a STR save, but can't do anything else. Nearby characters can attempt to free you by spending a round and passing a STR save.


* **Eye injury**.
You are unable to see from an eye. You halve the range of attacks and powers, and activities requiring depth perception, such as leaping, might be more challenging.


* **Frenzied**.
In combat, you can only spend your turn to attack, or if that's not possible to approach the closest enemy in preparation for a future attack. You are immune to fear, treat terror as fear, and you aren't _incapacitated_ by critical damage.


* **Frightened**.
Something scares you. You can't approach the source of your fear.


* **Groggy**.
You are dazed, weak, or unsteady from intoxication or sleep. Your attacks inflict impaired damage and your abilities are temporarily reduced by 2. When you clear this condition, your abilities are increased back by 2. If you become _groggy_ again while you already are, you become _incapacitated_ instead.


* **Hobbled**.
Your movement speed is halved, and you must use a stick or crutch to stand.


* **Incapacitated**.
You are unconscious or in terrible pain. You are completely unable to act and defenceless.


* **Poisoned**.
You are suffering from poison.


* **Sick**.
You are suffering from disease.


* **Silenced**.
You can't speak or emit sounds. Among other things, this renders you unable to invoke powers.


* **Stunned**.
You can't act for a round. In combat, this means you can't do anything the next time you take turn, and can't react until then.


* **Terrified**.
Something terrifies you. You must run away from the source of your terror, or if that's not possible, you cower down and can't do anything else.
