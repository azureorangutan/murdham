* **Aegis of Faith**.
Target a creature. The target appears surrounded by a blurry barrier and gains armour 1. It doesn't stack with equipped armour. The spell ends prematurely if the target is *incapacitated*, killed, or suffers corruption.
    * *Enhancement:* increase armour to 2. You can only apply this enhancement once.
* **Bless Water**.
Instantaneous. Target up to 2 bottles filled with clean water, which turn into *blessed water*.
    * *Enhancement:* you can target dirty water, no matter how filthy. It is cleansed and purified, turning pure and crystalline.
* **Call to Judgement**.
Instantaneous. Target a person and accuse them of a grave injustice they have allegedly committed. The target is engulfed by flames: they suffer d10 fire damage if guilty, but are unharmed if innocent. This spell doesn't work with minor accusations of little significance.
    * *Enhancement:* the flames burn the guilty into ashes, killing them on the spot.
* **Chant of Banishment**.
Instantaneous. Target a demon and pronounce its name. The target is instantly banished.
* **Chant of Unbroken Bravery**.
Target a creature. The target is immune to fear and morale. The spell ends prematurely if the target is *incapacitated*, killed, or suffers corruption.
    * *Enhancement:* the target emanates an intangible aura of bravery. Everyone else, friends or foe, in the same zone is also immune to fear and morale. Enhance again to double the range.
* **Prayer of Absolution**.
Instantaneous. Target a creature. The target heals 1 corruption.
    * *Enhancement:* double the amount of healed corruption.
* **Saint Austeria's Miracle of Healing**.
Instantaneous. Target a creature. The target recovers d8 health (at most half the maximum).
    * *Enhancement:* restore half the maximum health. Enhance again to restore health to the maximum.
* **Sanctuary of Purity**.
Target a zone. It is enveloped in a barely visible, translucent dome. Within it, arcane spells and magic items don't work, and demons, undead, and creatures born out of arcane magic suffer d4 direct damage at the end of each activation.
    * *Enhancement:* all zones within range 1 are also covered by the dome. Enhance again to double the range.
* **Sigil of the Exorcist**.
Target an item. The burning sigil of the two-headed serpent appears on it, making it impossible for demons, undead, and creatures born out of arcane magic to voluntarily touch it.
    * *Enhancement:* a holy sigil burns incandescent on the item and is clearly visible. Demons and undead are frightened by it.
* **The Martyr's Burden**.
Target two creatures. When either of them suffers damage or ability loss, half is transferred to the other.
    * *Enhancement:* as long as one of the targets lives, the other does as well, no matter how terrible their wounds are. However, if they were supposed to die while under the effect of the spell, they succumb once it ends.
* **Watch Over the Final Repose**.
Target a corpse. It will not decay and can't be targeted by arcane spells.
    * *Enhancement:* the body acts as a conduit to the spirit of the demised. People can pray in front of the corpse and ask a question. The spirit might sporadically grant an answer.
* **White Flame of Sarush**.
Instantaneous. Target an unlit light source, such as a *candle*, an *oil lamp*, a *torch*, or a bonfire. It is instantly lit with a bright white flame. The flame grants protection from poison, venom, and disease to those under its light, but doesn't cure already afflicted people.
    * *Enhancement:* the flame is particularly intense, and the light radius is doubled. If this enhancement is applied more than once, the light becomes so bright that it blinds anyone looking directly at it.
